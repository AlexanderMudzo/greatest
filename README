A unit testing system for C, contained in 1 file. It doesn't use dynamic
allocation or depend on anything beyond ANSI C89.

To use, just #include greatest.h in your project. Note that there are
some compile time options, and additional functionality (parametric
testing) is available if compiled with -std=c99.

For usage examples, look at example.c and example-suite.c.
